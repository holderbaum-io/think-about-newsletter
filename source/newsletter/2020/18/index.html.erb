    The Think About! conference would have started today :(
  <% end %>

  <% partial 'text' do %>
    <p>
      In March we decided to cancel the Think About! conference due to the corona pandemic and we are still convinced that this was the right and reasonable decision. At the same time we are still very sad and canâ€™t put into words how we feel - especially today.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why we felt the need to connect with all of you today ðŸ’– and take the opportunity to relive the Think About! 2019 edition. In this newsletter we have put together different sources for you to enjoy last year's event content again. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And we also have some good news to share: We are still planning to come back with the Think About! conference in 2021. At the moment we are working on a research project which we will share with you within the next few weeks. So stay tuned :)
