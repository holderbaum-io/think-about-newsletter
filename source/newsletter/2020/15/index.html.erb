    A note regarding CleverReach
  <% end %>

  <% partial 'text' do %>
    <p>
      After two Newsletters with CleverReach instead of selfhosted
      phpList/mailtrain we are quite happy with the solution. Especially now,
      since we were able to deactivate <b>ALL</b> tracking features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence being that we can not see the "conversion rate" of our
      newsletter - that is how we used our newsletters previously and that is
      how we like it.
