    <p>
      CryptoParties are free and open for everyone, but especially â€‹for
      those without prior knowledge, who haven't yet attended one.
    </p>
    <p>
      CryptoParty is a decentralized movement with events happening all over
      the world. The goal is to pass on knowledge about protecting yourself in
      the digital space. This can include encrypted communication, preventing
      being tracked while browsing the web, and general security advice
      regarding computers and smartphones.
