      We had some technical issues with our newsletter software. Those are now
      fixed, since we switched to a paid subscription with a new provider, that
      is <a href="https://cleverreach.de/">CleverReach</a>.
    <p>
      They are a German company and they store all their customers data in
      European data centers under GDPR compliance.

      If you still want to be subscribed to our newsletter, just click the
      subscribe button below to finalize your subscription.

      text: 'Subscribe Now',
      link: 'https://think-about.io/newsletter/thank-you.html'
    } %>

  <% partial 'text' do %>
    <p>
      If you've decided against the subscription by now you can <a
      href="{UNSUBSCRIBE}">cancel your subscription here</a>.

      We will delete all email addresses that have not explicitly clicked on
      the subscribe button above by the end of November 2019.
