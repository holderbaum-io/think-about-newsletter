# The Think About! Website

This is the code for the main Think About! Website, fully responsive.

It contains semantical HTML5 and a mostly class-less minimal CSS styling.

## Development

To see changes locally, simply run:

```sh
./do run
```

This starts a webserver, which you can visit here: http://localhost:9090/ .
